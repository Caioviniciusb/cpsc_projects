# Donkey Kong Game

During the Winter term of 2023, my friend Aaron and I took on a super cool project for our CPSC 359 course, we had to make a game inspired by Donkey Kong. We had plenty of freedom to get creative and code the game, but we had to meet certain requirements.

We used the C programming language and ran the game on a Raspberry Pi. In the beginning, it was a bit tough, but when the pieces started falling into place, we had a lot of fun! I mean, who doesn't want to make their own video game, right?!

Here are the main functions used in the game, where you can see how we structured it. If you want to see a video demonstration here follow the link to it. I hope you enjoy it :)
